# Slowfood Challenge @Craft Academy
#### 2018-09-19

This is a webstore app that offers user the ability to buy food online. A visitor can select food from four different categories and add it to a "cart". Upon checkout the user will be asked to signup or log in.

Created with Ruby on Rails and tested with Rspec and Cucumber. Gems of particular note are Cartify (adding products to cart and checking them out) and Devise for user authentication.
