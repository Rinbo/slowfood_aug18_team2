Feature: Product Categories
  As a user
  In order to make it easier to find what I want
  I would like to see a list of items ordered by category

  Background: 
    Given the following categories exists
      | name       |
      | Starter    |
      | Main       |
      | Dessert    |
      | Beverage   |

  
    Given the following products exists    
      | name         | description    | price | category    |
      | Pizza        | Cheesy         |   5   |  Main       |
      | Hamburger    | Spicy          |   30  |  Main       |
      | Sallad       | Spicy          |   30  |  Starter    |
      | Tacos        | Spicy          |   30  |  Starter    |
      | Pie          | Spicy          |   30  |  Dessert    |
      | Coca Cola    | Sweet          |   20  |  Beverage   |

  Scenario: A product should have a category
    Given I visit the landing page
    Then I should see "5.00 kr" for "Pizza"
    And I should see "Spicy" for "Sallad"
    And I should see "30.00 kr" for "Pie"
